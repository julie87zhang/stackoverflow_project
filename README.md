## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

what are their educational backgrounds and what does the data suggest of HighestEducation in terms of salary. And if attend bootcamp can boost their salary even without higher education? How those respondents learn to enter or plan to enter this field and which programming languages they are using ?  which factors decide the job satisfaction level of developers?

## File Descriptions
There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.


## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post.
